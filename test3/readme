JSX React - What is happening behind scenes
Basic HTML, javascript and css files.
skeleton or markup inside the html, logic on the page written in javascript

React as well tries to merge these things up ,
so that it does everything in one file jsx, 
JSX is convention where we merge this html and js together.
JSX is not a HTML inside javascript, it is html or xml like syntax.


Any piece of javascript understands es6 - JS engine understands
all the versions of the es6. 
Browser will not understand html code.

Parcel is working on converting the JSX in to ec6.
Before it goes to JS engine, 
JSX code is transpiled to js syntax for js engine that react can understand.
Babel transpiles the jsx code to react.CreateElement.


JSX - parcel - Babel



Babel is a javascript compiler.
